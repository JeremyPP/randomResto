## Idea board for the Random Resto webApp.


### TODO:

- Choose between a json and a small MySQL DB to save the restaurant list. (will need to be a DB in the future).
- Setup/create initial restaurant list
- An item in the restaurant list must have: Name, address, category (cheap/expensive),... More to be defined later.
- Display a different random item from the list every day.


### LATER:

- Google map integration. (Display restaurant address on an interactive map).
- Integration with another API to provide an alternative choice (Discover).
- Add new items to the restaurant list.


### Future:

- Voting system.
- Confirmation button (did we went there?).
- Account creation (Groups).
