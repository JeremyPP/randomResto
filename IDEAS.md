## Idea board for the Random Resto webApp.


### TODO:

#### DB
- Setup small DB for accounts and groups

#### Forms
- Account creation (user must have: Name, email, password, and optional photo).
- Group creation: A user can create a new group and add other users to it based on the email (maybe by the name? to be discussed).
- Manage resto list of the new group (Add a new item).
- An item in the restaurant list of a group must have: Name, address, tags,... More to be defined later.
- A group can be either public or private so that other groups can explore it (or not)
- The resto list is attached to a group

#### Algo
- The algorithm to select the restaurant to show should give a chance to a new one (not yet tested) but probably less than already tested with good votes
- Display the same different random item from the list each day to all members of the group (with an alternate option as well => to discuss).
- 2 options: display only one restaurant OR display one restaurant by tags => option is selected by admin of the group



### LATER:

(Ideas to be discussed)

- Confirmation button (did we went there?) Individual for each user.
- Voting system (if you say you went there you can give it a rating. A rating can only be given once per user per restaurant.)
- Integration with another API to provide an alternative choice (Discover button). ??
- User history.
- ...
